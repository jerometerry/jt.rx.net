      <title>Overview</title>
      <content>
        <para>Potassium is made up of 4 primitives with 14 operations.</para>

        <para>
          The primitives are <legacyBold>Event</legacyBold>, and <legacyBold>Behavior</legacyBold>.
        </para>

        <list class="bullet">
          <listItem>
            <legacyBold>Behavior</legacyBold> - A dynamic value that updates via an Event
          </listItem>

          <listItem>
            <legacyBold>Event</legacyBold> - A stream of values (event occurrences) that can be observed
          </listItem>

          <listItem>
            <legacyBold>FirableEvent</legacyBold> - An Event that exposes a Fire method
          </listItem>

          <listItem>
            <legacyBold>EventRepeater</legacyBold> - EventRepeater fires values observed from another Event
          </listItem>
        </list>

        <para>The operations are Accum, Apply, Coalesce, Collect, Filter, Fire, Gate, Hold, Lift, Map, Merge, Repeat, Snapshot, Switch</para>

        <para>Potassium uses the Publish / Subscribe Pattern: FirableEvent fires events, Observable.Subscribe listens for the events.</para>

      <title>Key Operations</title>
      <content>
        <list class="bullet">
          <listItem>
            <legacyBold>Accum</legacyBold> - Accum converts an Event, an initial value, and a snapshot function into a Behavior that accumulates a value as the Event fires.

            <para>An example would having a running sum total, starting with an initial value and using the addition operation as the snapshot.</para>
          </listItem>

          <listItem>
            <legacyBold>Apply</legacyBold> - Apply is the process of taking a Behavior and a Behavior of mapping functions, to produce of a new Behavior of the return type of the mapping function inside the Behavior. This is the primitive for Behavior lifting.
          </listItem>

          <listItem>
            <legacyBold>Coalesce</legacyBold> - Coalesce is the process of combining several simultaneous values into a single value.
          </listItem>

          <listItem>
            <legacyBold>Collect</legacyBold> - Collect transforms an Event or Behavior with a generalized state loop (a mealy machine). The function is passed the input and the old state and returns the new state and output value.
          </listItem>

          <listItem>
            <legacyBold>Filter</legacyBold> - Filters Event values based on a predicate, similar to the LINQ Where method.
          </listItem>

          <listItem>
            <legacyBold>Fire</legacyBold> - Firing is the process of sending a value through an Event.
          </listItem>

          <listItem>
            <legacyBold>Gate</legacyBold> - Gating is the process of now allowing Firing values that don't evaluate to true through a given gate predicate.
          </listItem>

          <listItem>
            <legacyBold>Hold</legacyBold> - A Hold is an operation on an Event given an initial value, that creates a Behavior with the initial value that updates whenever the Event fires.
          </listItem>

          <listItem>
            <para>
              <legacyBold>Lift</legacyBold> - Lifting is the process of taking a multi-valued function (2 or 3 valued functions in Potassium), along with Behaviors for each value of the function, and creating a new Behavior that is computed by evaluating the function with the current values of each of the Behaviors values.
            </para>

            <para>A lifted Behavior has the property that if any of the input Behaviors are modified simultaneously, the lifted Behavior should fire only once.</para>

            <para>
              <legacyBold>Lift Glitch</legacyBold> - A lift glitch occurs if a lifted Behavior fires multiple times in response to simultaneous updates of it's input Behaviors.
            </para>
          </listItem>

          <listItem>
            <legacyBold>Map</legacyBold> - A map is the process of converting an Event or Behavior from one type to another, by supplying a mapping function.
          </listItem>

          <listItem>
            <legacyBold>Merge</legacyBold> - Merging is the process of combining two Events of the same type into a single Event, using a coalesce (combining) function.
          </listItem>

          <listItem>
            <legacyBold>Repeat</legacyBold> - Repeating is a way of chaining together Events. Given an Event e and an EventRepeater f, f.Repeat(e) will cause firings on e to be fired on f.
          </listItem>

          <listItem>
            <legacyBold>Snapshot</legacyBold> - Snapshot is the process of sampling a Behaviors value at the time of an Event firing, and producing a value (a snapshot) by passing the value of the Behavior at the time of the firing and the value fired on the Event into a snapshot function.
          </listItem>

          <listItem>
            <legacyBold>Switch</legacyBold> - Switch is the process of unwrapping a Behavior of Behaviors or a Behavior of Events into the inner Behavior or Event. Switch allows the reactive network to change dynamically, using reactive logic to modify reactive logic.

      <title>Related Concepts</title>
      <content>
        <para>Below are some additional concepts to be aware of inside of the Potassium library.</para>

        <list class="bullet">
          <listItem>
            <legacyBold>Transaction</legacyBold> - A Transaction is used to provide the concept of simultaneous Events.

            <para>In Potassium, only one Transaction can be open at a time. A Transaction is requested when registering a listener, or when firing a value. A Transaction is closed when the initial request that created the Transaction completes.</para>

            <para>Firing and listening can cause a chain reaction of operations that may cause other firing and listening operations. This chain of operations will all execute inside the same Transaction.</para>

            <para>Once a Transaction has been opened, actions can be added to it, using the High, Medium and Low methods.</para>

            <para>High registers the action on a Priority Queue using a Rank to order. Medium and Low are run in the order they are added.</para>

            <para>All High priority actions are run first (using Priority Queue), all Medium Priority actions second (by order added), and all Low priority actions third (by order added).</para>

            <para>High, Medium and Low priority actions are run when the Transaction is closed when the operation that requested the Transaction completes.</para>
          </listItem>

          <listItem>
            <legacyBold>Priority</legacyBold> - Priority is used to determine the order to execute High priority items in a Transaction. A lower priority value executes before a higher priority, as is typically with Priority Queues.

            <para>A Priority is assigned to an Observable, with a default priority of zero. A Priority has an operation to add a superior, with a class invariant that all superiors must have a higher priority than their subordinates.</para>

            <para>An Observables Priority can be modified (increased) when it registers itself to listen to another Observable. The subscribers priority should be higher than the source rank, so that the source rank High operations in a Transaction execute before those of their subscribers.</para>

            <para>The Priority of an Observable is used when registering High priority actions on a Transaction, as a means to ensure actions are run on a priority basis.</para>
